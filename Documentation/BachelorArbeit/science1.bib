  Abstract                 = {Spatial patterns in biological populations and the effect of spatial patterns on ecological interactions are central topics in mathematical ecology. Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by “moment closure,” neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models. },

  Abstract                 = {We consider an interacting particle Markov process for Darwinian evolution in an asexual population with non-constant population size, involving a linear birth rate, a density-dependent logistic death rate, and a probability μ of mutation at each birth event. We introduce a renormalization parameter K scaling the size of the population, which leads, when K → + ∞ , to a deterministic dynamics for the density of individuals holding a given trait. By combining in a non-standard way the limits of large population ( K → + ∞ ) and of small mutations ( μ → 0 ), we prove that a timescale separation between the birth and death events and the mutation events occurs and that the interacting particle microscopic process converges for finite dimensional distributions to the biological model of evolution known as the “monomorphic trait substitution sequence” model of adaptive dynamics, which describes the Darwinian evolution in an asexual population as a Markov jump process in the trait space.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a discrete model that describes a locally regulated spatial population with mortality selection. This model was studied in parallel by Bolker and Pacala and Dieckmann, Law and Murrell. We first generalize this model by adding spatial dependence. Then we give a pathwise description in terms of Poisson point measures. We show that different normalizations may lead to different macroscopic approximations of this model. The first approximation is deterministic and gives a rigorous sense to the number density. The second approximation is a superprocess previously studied by Etheridge. Finally, we study in specific cases the long time behavior of the system and of its deterministic approximation.},
